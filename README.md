# mouse_control_using_face

This project labels an actual interaction permitted eye stare tracing software that feet precision with an extraordinary, strict appraisal of a user in the center. This camera trails skull actions upholding the user-centered. Sometimes while tracing errors may occur, a face from a webcam through a widespread area vision is needed to localize the eye and immediately recuperate the tracing procedure. A distinct form was broken for permitting the optimization of processing the image procedures established for this product. Subsequently, a standardization formula, a link of stare, is committed using the user flash vector. The vertical and horizontal points of the eyes have been authenticated by using iris summary, which eliminates the glint falsification owed to the differences in warp on the ocular sphere. These suggested processes define user center having fill in-pixel firmness, reducing a quantity mistake in user flash vector. There three main phases which have a significant role in this project. They are mouth recognition, eye blink detection, and face movement detection, which play an essential role in moving the mouse cursor.
